# open-metaverse-interface

Currently in prototyping stage. PRs *extremely* welcome.

We are mainly focused on the user schema right now, although assets may be split off and worlds may also be considered in the future. The goal is to iterate pragmatically upon what exists and what we can wire up to virtual worlds today and not worry about more complicated use cases until we arrive at them.
